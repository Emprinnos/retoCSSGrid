          I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
          current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I
          got every penny&#39;s worth.

          &quot; I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp.
          I&#39;ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some people
          who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro
          course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The
          next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life.
          Since completing the course, I&#39;ve successfully switched careers,
          working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. &quot;

          Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!
        </p>
        <p class="user-description2">
          &quot; Before joining the bootcamp, I&#39;ve never written a line of
          code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
          programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
          student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.
          The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very
          hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
          project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the
          next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact,
          I&#39;ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my
          developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a
          full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!

          Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves.
          Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was
          easy.
        </p>
        <p class="user-description2">
          &quot; The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I
          find really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary
          to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable
          junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the
          personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and
          amazing people. &quot;
